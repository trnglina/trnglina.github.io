      The thing with
      <abbr title="Didn’t I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?!"
        >Noukin</abbr
      >
      is that it doesn’t have a serious bone in its body. Not a single one. No
      matter what serious topic comes up, it’ll top it off with some comic
      relief and leave you feeling either uncomfortably unsatisfied, or, if you
      quickly came to like the characters like I did, with mixed feelings of
      genuine relief.

        takes you on a comedic roller coaster of tension and quick relief.

      Ultimately, whether this technique works for you depends on how willing
      you are to accept it. It’s perfectly fair to view
      <abbr title="Didn’t I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?!"
        >Noukin</abbr
      >
      as having no consistent tone, and unwilling to tell a meaningful story,
      but I don’t really think that’s the point. If you’re looking for a serious
      and dramatic story about family, death, and friendship, well, this isn’t
      the show for you.

        is consistently funny if you like its sense of humour, but offers
        nothing more for those who don’t.

      is a comedy through and through—and if you don’t find the first couple of
      episodes funny, there’s nothing more this show can offer you. If you do,
      however, it’s an enjoyable ride. (If you’re familiar with anime, you might
      recognise the director Oota Masahiko; this show is pretty similar to his
      other comedies.) The characters are likeable (if generally shallow and
      clichéd), its visuals are pretty (if not exactly beautiful), and it has
      most of the typical isekai trappings.
