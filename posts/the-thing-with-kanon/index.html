    <h1>The Thing With Kanon</h1>
    <p><time datetime="2021-01-21">21 Jan, 2021</time></p>
    <p>
      Have you seen
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/1530/Kanon_2006">Kanon</a>? It’s a
      Kyoto Animation adaptation of a Key visual novel with supernatural
      elements, and focusing on the dramatic interactions between the main hero
      and a number of heroines… and please, stop me once you’re reminded of,
      well, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/2167/Clannad">Clannad</a>?
      I’m not going to focus too much on the intersection between Kanon and
      Clannad, so I’ll leave this point noting that Kanon, Clannad’s predecessor
      as both a visual novel, and as an anime, almost never outshines its more
      famous younger sibling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, however, I’d like to focus on Kanon’s contents a little:
      specifically, its ending. Without spoiling what happens explicitly, I
      would describe it as “unsatisfying”—unsatisfying because of how quickly it
      goes by, because of how unreasonable it seems, and because of how
      thoroughly the work had driven itself into a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s start with pacing. Kanon’s ending is fast, because it needs to be.
      In a sense, the pacing problem of the last episode comes from the
      <em>quality</em> of the pacing in previous episodes. One of the places
      where I must respect Kanon is its willingness to take it slow, and let the
      viewer’s emotions brew alongside those of the characters. Unfortunately,
      this leaves the last episode with a lot to resolve, and very little time
      to do it. As a result, it feels like a high-speed montage of emotional
      moment after emotional moment, hollowing the effect of each, as they lack
      the time to sink into the viewer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unreasonableness of Kanon’s ending comes from a different, more
      fundamental place. They come from the show’s view that, in a capricious
      world, where each of us are powerless in the face of most suffering we
      come into contact with, and most suffering we never even know of, the only
      cure that can be sought is miracle. And while I think there’s a very
      reasonable realist root for that worldview, it makes for troublesome
      storytelling. When you believe we are powerless, the only thing you can
      show is characters addressing and working within that powerlessness. You
      don’t get a great struggle; you don’t have a villain. This is the
      storytelling model Kanon adopts for most of its character dramas, and most
      of the earlier resolutions are based in this fundamental sense of
      powerlessness.
    </p>
    <p>At the end, however, Kanon does something rather cowardly.</p>
    <p>
      Even as it explores that sense of powerlessness; even as it seeks to
      answer the discomfort and uncertainty that comes with powerlessness, it
      decides it needs a happy ending.
    </p>
    <p>
      It fails to stick to its own answers. It cheapens the tears of its
      characters, and denies the very inevitability of death it had used as a
      dramatic tool. In the name of a happy ending, it lets “miracles”—in its
      own words!—sweep away every tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, its remarks ultimately feel a little hollow to me. How can I
      listen to the answers Kanon gives me, if it’s too scared to follow through
      on them? In facing one’s mortality, Kanon provides no comfort, because, in
      the end, it’s scared of its own premise. So instead of accepting the
      fortunes it set up for its own plot, and its own characters, it bets on a
      miracle, and rewards itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kanon’s ending is unsatisfying, and indulgent, and provides neither hope,
      nor despair. It is a coward’s ending. And for that reason, it can only
      leave a poor taste in my mouth.
