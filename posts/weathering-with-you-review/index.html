      Weathering With You is an ultimate demonstration of director Shinkai
      Makoto’s stellar directorial sense. The visuals, voice acting, music, and
      character writing are all spectacular. In terms of plot, the show
      occasionally rides the edge of disbelief, but if you let yourself get
      carried along by the film, you’ll hardly notice it. Its brief meanderings
      near melodrama might put off the most cynical and critical viewers—but if
      you believe films should be enjoyed, Weathering with you makes it very
      easy.

        alt="The animated gif begins with a medium close up shot of the male lead, Hodaka, looking astonished as leaves and drops of water rise into the overcast sky above. It cuts to the female lead, Hina, who brings down her hands, originally in prayer, and looks back with a smile as beams of sunlight begin to shine down from the top-left corner."

      Weathering With You is an optimistic tale, bursting with the flavours of
      youth. If you have the chance, see it. If it’s no longer in cinemas where
      you are, wait for a physical or streaming release. It’s good enough to
      warrant a little wait.
