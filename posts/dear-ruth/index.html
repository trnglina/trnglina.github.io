    <h2 id="spring">Spring</h2>
    <p>Dear Ruth,</p>
    <p>
      Spring arrives quickly up here, and shows its face loudly. The leaves are
      eager to bud, and rekindle the life in worn branches that must have
      spanned many more ages than us. Some of the trees wake earlier than
      others; the earliest have already burst into pale-coloured blossoms, which
      decorate the side streets. Everywhere I look, life is returning. Just
      outside my window are patches of grass—equally brown and green—from the
      burden of winter, and the sheerness of spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plants are more eager than me. Or perhaps they’re just better
      accustomed. Every morning, when I stick a toe out from under my blankets
      to test the air, I flinch from the cold air’s sting. How blessed I would
      be, if I could just wrap myself in a blanket all day!
    </p>
    <p>
      Were it not for work, I would. At least the people are kind, and the
      routines are fine enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that said, the office reminds me of our sixth grade English
      classroom, where the teacher hung his posters of English grammar, next to
      anatomic diagrams of the human body. I don’t remember if I ever told you
      this, but around the end of that year, I left a little bag of mouldy
      strawberries behind his desk. I’d like to think he found them first,
      before the janitor could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes, not to forget this, but in all that’s happened, I’ve only just
      remembered to celebrate. Happy birthday! To you, and to me. I always
      thought it was a lovely coincidence we were born only two days apart. I
      didn’t do much to celebrate this year—made a warm bowl of soup and watched
      the late spring snow. But last year was wonderful. Wonderful enough for
      both these years, I think. Wonder enough that I still think about the walk
      we had around that park together, kicking up the fallen cherry petals that
      someone must’ve spent so long raking… we made pink clouds with our feet.
      Up here, there are only hawthorns in bloom. And they are white.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daylight is still short, but the days are long. As I watch the sunset
      from my desk, I want to feel its warmth. If not through the window, then
      at least in its colour. As I walk through the streets, rubbing my hands
      together for heat, the dark sky weighs on my back. The light of countless
      stars stretch out behind me, and I can hardly breathe to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first spring in a new home: the earth is cold, the sky is wide, and the
      stars are bright.
    </p>
    <p>Best regards,</p>
    <p>Violet.</p>
    <h2 id="summer">Summer</h2>
    <p>Dear Ruth,</p>
    <p>
      The song of the summer rain haunts my ears. The drops splatter dully
      across the leaves, and onto the ground. Streams burst to life, flowing
      from anywhere down to nowhere, and carrying the impurities of the earth on
      their backs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s wet, but it’s not hot. The dampness creeps under my skin, but it’s
      not entirely unpleasant. A little water in the muscles couldn’t hurt. It’s
      all we are, after all. I’m just a bag of water stumbling through a dry
      world. Perhaps, for all our sakes, the rain should fall harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      My coworkers keep asking me out to drinks after work, and I keep refusing.
      It’s tiring—and I wish you could be here, to give me advice, or to give me
      comfort. It’s not that I don’t like them or anything. But I don’t take
      well to late nights or the drink. I worry what I might say, and what I
      might feel, and I worry that I’ll laugh too hard, or cry. And I couldn’t
      bear to cry. God knows I need the water more than the earth does.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still—the summer air is thick with memories, and they burrow deeper than
      the water. The last time I drank, we were together, and it was summer. And
      on that night, in part or in whole, the worst of my worries came true.
      Still, when I think back, I can’t help but smile—despite the
      embarrassment, the tears, and the nausea. Maybe it was because of you, or
      maybe it was always just my mind tricking my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe if I did go, I would have fun; make friends; maybe I would smile—if
      not in the moment, then in some fond memory down the road. But I can’t
      bring myself to think that way of my coworkers. They’re nice. Maybe it’s
      because I don’t feel like I can return the favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, under the rushing rain, let me set my fondness afloat down a
      stream, because it’s a fondness I have yet to feel. But don’t feel sad for
      me. I’m a rambler anyway, and fondness is a curse for people like me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summer, in a distant and wet land: the earth is being washed away; but I
      float on.
    </p>
    <p>With love,</p>
    <p>Violet.</p>
    <h2 id="autumn">Autumn</h2>
    <p>Dear Ruth,</p>
    <p>
      The fall colours are jolly; the autumn air is chilling; and the streets
      are littered with dry leaves and insect husks. With the slightest gust of
      wind, their shallow remains lift off the ground, as though unable to rest
      for another second, and dance in wild swirls before drifting back down.
      They take grand steps with elegance and poise, as the wind breaths the
      very air of life into them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But autumn is neither a season of life, nor is it a time of death. It is a
      season of deception. It is a handsome man in a beautiful coat, reaching
      out his hand. And year after year, he takes you to see the most beautiful
      things: mountains of gentle gold; forests of passionate red. You gasp from
      within his embrace, and with a single breath, the peaceful air stills you.
    </p>
    <p>I won’t be caught off-guard.</p>
    <p>
      The papers are piling up—every morning, my desk is a skyscraper under
      construction, reaching its peak around noon, only for me to take it down,
      brick by brick, into the evening. But I only see it as a good thing. At
      first, I only got the soft stuff; but now, my eyes are deep in money and
      secrets. The department head trusts me, and working to the last lamp means
      no one waits around to put a drink in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday, a girl—younger than me!—who recently joined the company, told
      me I was working too hard. She told me it was bad for my mind, and my
      body, and invited me out on a walk. “To see the autumn colours”—to fall
      into his arms, and let him grab you. As a person, I told her there were
      bigger things to worry about. As a senior, I told her she shouldn’t be
      taking walks during work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m working more than ever, but my mind has never been so clear. Just last
      week, the department head praised me on my attention to detail. He said he
      had never seen such meticulous and attentive work. I couldn’t say anything
      to accept the compliment. With the haze that had lingered behind my eyes…
      It felt like I had been wronging him until now.
    </p>
    <p>If only I could’ve always seen so clearly.</p>
    <p>
      It was late fall when you tapped on my shoulder, and instead of listening,
      I grabbed you by the arm, and pulled us both into autumn’s embrace.
    </p>
    <p>Would you have had me do anything different?</p>
    <p>Violet.</p>
    <h2 id="winter">Winter</h2>
    <p>Dear Ruth,</p>
    <p>
      As I breathe on the windowpane, I paint with white on white. As my marks
      fade away, only the thinnest layer of ice is left behind, and I cannot see
      the outside, but through its distortions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can feel my heartbeat in my head, and it pounds from my brain through my
      skull. The world of snow outside is shimmering and bright, but all the
      windows, except one, are covered. I’ve opened a single curtain, to write
      this letter under sunlight, but on the pristine white page, I can hardly
      see the marks of my pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I missed the first snow. I fell so suddenly so ill that before I could
      feel the time pass by, it had, and snow was on the ground. I had been
      sleeping in that time, and in a dream, I saw you board a plane—from our
      hometown, all the way over here. You traced my steps, and I was there too,
      at times. But when you knocked on my front door, and you kicked your boot
      against the foundation to loosen the snow—when I opened, and saw you,
      dressed in a blue coat and with snow falling all around you—I was here,
      and you were there. And I felt so happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I almost cried when I was finally well enough to open the curtains, and
      see the clear sky reflected from below. That moment, it became clear: no
      matter how hard I work, or how long I pray, or how many tricks my mind
      plays on itself, my eyes will never again see you standing there, beneath
      the falling snow. We’ll never feel the sting of a snowflake landing on
      bare skin again. We’ll never see the beauty of the autumn leaves again.
      We’ll never share a drink on a stuffy summer evening again. And we’ll
      never celebrate our birthdays, together, again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you remember when we climbed out back to the old shack on my
      grandparents’ farm? We had been there before—we even set up a little base
      however many years ago—but, by then, last year, you looked like you could
      barely walk. Yet even if I had to carry you through waist-high snow and
      across rocky fields, I wanted you to see the stars again. No—the stars had
      nothing to do with it. I just wanted to be in an empty and peaceful place
      together, and nowhere else was so empty, and so peaceful. Once we got
      there, and I helped you onto your back in the middle of that roofless
      shack, I don’t think you said another word. I don’t remember saying
      anything either. I only stared at you, with the same dumb shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      I watched your eyes, as they gazed upwards, but I could only see you as I
      always had: calm and mature, but locked in the same ignorant shock as me.
      Only now can I see how scared you looked, and despite that, how much you
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tonight, though my head still hurts, and my muscles are weak, I will step
      out into the snow, and let myself be bathed in starlight. Out there, under
      the wings of heaven, is the closest I can get to you. For now.
    </p>
    <p>
      That shack surely still stands. On some snowy winter day, years from now,
      when I’m older still, I’ll find my way back home. And when I do, let’s
      meet again—in that roofless shack, across stone and snow, under the
      immeasurable gaze of countless stars.
    </p>
    <p>Until that day,</p>
    <p>Violet.</p>
