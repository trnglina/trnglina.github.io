      The CrW is the University of Alberta’s Creative Writing Club—a social
      group for creative writers in the university and city.

    <h2 id="guest-speaker-posters">Guest Speaker Posters</h2>
    <p>
      The CrW often invites figures from the local writing community to speak
      about their experiences and answer questions. I have helped worked
      alongside the Club’s executive team to create a set of promotional social
      media posters for these events.

    <p>
      Starting in 2019, and progressing through 2020, the CrW produced a debut
      anthology featuring work by members of the club, and the greater
      university community. In this endeavour, I created physical and digital
      posters for the purpose of recruiting editors and writers.
